                    <p>Mechanical engineering is the discipline that applies engineering, physics, and materials science principles to design, analyze, manufacture, and maintain mechanical systems. It is the branch of engineering that involves the design, production, and operation of machinery. It is one of the oldest and broadest of the engineering disciplines. The Mechanical Engineering Department was established in the academic year 2004. The department has qualified, motivated and experienced faculty. Majority of the faculty are having varied experience of industrial, teaching and research which help to serve the students in exposing them to industrial and research environment.</p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <p>The department organizes various student level technical events regularly which include workshops, guest lectures, industrial visits and technical seminars to expose the student's inherent talent and skills. The department also organizes events like Faculty Development Programs (FDP), conferences and workshops to expose the faculty to latest technologies. The department also conducts various certification courses in advanced technologies such as CAD / CAM, in association with reputed professional training institutes. Mechanical department is well equipped with lab facilities for the students, which includes Basic Engineering Workshop to most modern CNC machine shop.</p>
                    <p>CNC lathe and Milling machine has been installed at the cost of 15 lakhs. Students are trained during summer vacation for Projects for PROFESSIONAL PRACTICE at School, at various industries and are imparted. Value added Courses are conducted to enhance their soft skills. Placement Training is imparted right from 3rd year 1st semester onwards by best of HR Professional Trainers, drawn from the best HR Company.</p>
